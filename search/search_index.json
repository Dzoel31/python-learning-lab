Some of the topics I have explored and plan to explore include:</p> <ul> <li>Python Basics: Data types, control structures, functions, and modules.</li> <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li> <li>Testing: Testing using pytest.</li> <li>Web Scraping: Extracting data from websites using BeautifulSoup and requests.</li> <li>Data Science: Using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis.</li> <li>Machine Learning: Introduction to scikit-learn and basic models.</li> <li>Web Development: Introduction to Flask or maybe Django. But I curiously want to explore FastAPI.</li> <li>GitHub Actions: Automating workflows with GitHub Actions, including:</li> <li>Creating workflows for automated testing.</li> <li>Implementing DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin).</li> <li>Other automation tasks.</li> <li>Docker: Using Docker for containerizing Python applications. (Can be extended to implement for other languages)</li> <li>API Development: Building RESTful APIs with FastAPI.</li> <li>Release Management: Managing releases using GitHub Releases.</li> <li>Database: Interacting with databases.</li> <li>Asynchronous Programming: Introduction to async/await and using libraries like asyncio.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#field-of-interest","title":"Field of Interest","text":"<p>I am also interested in exploring other topics such as:</p> <ul> <li>Data Engineering: Data pipelines, ETL processes, and data warehousing.</li> <li>Cloud Computing: Deploying Python applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.</li> <li>DevOps Practices: Integrating Python with DevOps tools and practices.</li> <li>Machine Learning Operations (MLOps): Managing machine learning models in production.</li> <li>Deep Learning: Exploring deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#contribution","title":"Contribution","text":"<p>Feel free to contribute or suggest topics you would like to see explored. You can make your own documentation or open an issue or pull request. All contributions are greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Let's learn Python together!</p> <p>Jk, I made this documentation to fill my free time.
